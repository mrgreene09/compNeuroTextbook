# Preface  
  What you are about to read is an open textbook written for (and by) students of Computational Neuroscience at Bates College. This is version 0.0 of a living document that will be revised, reused, and appended over the course of many generations of this course. As the instructor of this course, I want to briefly outline *my* motivations for undertaking this project in hopes that this idea may spread.

## This book is free (as in pizza)  
  It is broadly accepted that [college affordability](https://collegecost.ed.gov/) is a key challenge for the U.S. in the 21st century. One of the drivers of increased college cost is the increased cost of course textbooks. Over the past 40 years, textbook prices have risen over [1200% over the last 40 years](https://www.slideshare.net/kcangial/teaching-in-the-open-bates-college) -- much higher than the rate of inflation, and higher even than housing or healthcare! By creating a free textbook, we are broadening the participation of students in computational neuroscience.

## This book is free (as in speech)  
  As important as cost-free textbooks is, equally important are the freedoms that openness provides. We are opening this resource for reuse, revision, and redistribution. We welcome others to remix into other works. It is my belief that the availability of high-quality resources allows for creativity and innovation to spring up in others. My teaching and scholarship has benefitted greatly from openly available sources, and I feel that my success as an academic is to pay this forward.

## This book can be revised and disseminated more rapidly than traditional textbooks  
  Part of the impetus of this book came from a frustration in finding a traditional textbook that was appropriate for my undergraduate, 300-level course in computational neuroscience. Many of the books, though excellent, assumed a graduate-level sophistication in mathematics. Nearly all were missing some of the most modern topics. Computational neuroscience is a rapidly-evolving field, so an open textbook allows for more rapid editing, addition, and dissemination than is afforded by a traditional publishing model.

## This book creates a public record of learning that exists after the semester ends  
  Part of the educational journey is making the leap between being a *consumer* of knowledge to being a *generator* of knowledge. It is oft-said but nonetheless true statement that one truly learns by teaching. This assignment places students in the role of teacher, making the content come alive by explaining it in their own words. All too often, the writing that we do in college is in the form of the “disposable assignment” - one that students will spend a few hours working on, that I will spend a few hours reading and grading, and then is thrown away. Writing an open textbook is more of a renewable assignment - one that will have value in the world long after the semester is over.

  We hope that you enjoy this book. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or comments about our work: mgreene2@bates.edu.
